Ultrasonic Automatic Home Door Security System


An Arduino-based smart security system that combines ultrasonic sensing technology with keypad authentication to create a sophisticated home door security solution.

Features:
1. Ultrasonic distance measurement for motion detection
2. 4x4 Matrix keypad for PIN authentication
3. LCD display for system status and feedback
4. Password protection (default: 2001)
5. Buzzer alarm system
6. Real-time distance monitoring

Components:
1. Arduino UNO
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
3. 16x2 LCD Display
4. 4x4 Matrix Keypad
5. Buzzer Module
6. Tilt Sensor
7. Breadboard and connecting wires

This project offers a dual-layer security approach by utilizing both motion detection and password authentication. The system monitors proximity using the ultrasonic sensor while requiring correct PIN entry for access, making it an effective solution for home security applications.
